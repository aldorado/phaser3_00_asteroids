# Asteroids
- Fly around
- destroy asteroids
- if they touch you, your rocketship is destroyed
- you have 3 rocketships
- a large sized asteroid lands you 20 credits
- a medium sized asteroid gets you 50 credits
- a small sized asteroid gets you 100 credits
## Points:
- 20pts - Large Asteroid
- 50pts - Medium Asteroid
- 100pts - Small Asteroid  

Ok, I had a liiiittle sideways idea, 
now the game gets exponential harder if all asteroids are destroyed  

So now per level more and faster asteroids, but they will give you more points  

I'm going stop here, I learned the phaser 3 basics
thats what I wanted to learn, see you at the next game
